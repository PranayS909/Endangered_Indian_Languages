Reviving the Forgotten Tongues: A Journey into Endangered Languages

Imagine a world where words that once carried centuries of culture, tradition, and identity have faded into silence. Every two weeks, we lose a language forever, taking with it a unique way of seeing and describing the world."
Our project bridges the gap between endangered languages and the masses. By preserving and celebrating these forgotten tongues, we safeguard the stories, wisdom, and cultural heritage and wisdom of generations.

The platform features an interactive map of India, divided into five regions: North, West, Central, East, and South. Selecting a region reveals a picture of that region and endangered languages. Information about the origin, cultural significance, and linguistic value of the selected languages is provided.
Our mission is to educate and inspire people, ensuring these incredible languages are revived, preserved, and celebrated for generations to come.
